# pigeonhole

Group communication protocols over Katzenpost's Pigeonhole storage, in Go and Rust.

Each protocol under `protocols/` has a sans-IO state machine, an engine that is a whole client
without IO, and a client that carries the engine's work out over a transport and keeps its state
on disk. Every step's changes are saved, synced, before any of the work it asks for starts.

- `protocols/katzenqt1`: katzenqt's group chat as of October 2026.
  - `wire`: message fields, GroupChatMessage CBOR, box framing, the reply to a new member, files.
  - `member`: one member of a group, as a state machine; its trace format, and katzenqt's
    scenario simulator.
  - `engine`: the client without IO.
  - `store`: its state, in bbolt; in Rust, redb, as a module of the client crate.
  - `client`: the client, over a transport.
- `transport`: what a client asks of Pigeonhole; over the client daemon's thin client, in memory
  for tests, and served from one process to others (`remote`, JSON-RPC).
- `cmd/katzenqt1` (Go) and `src/bin/katzenqt1.rs` (`katzenqt1-rs`): clients without a user
  interface, for scripts and interop tests; `cmd/pigeonhole-sim` serves an in-memory Pigeonhole.

`examples/` has a minimal group chat in Go and in Rust, as an introduction to the client.

Go is at the root; Rust is one crate, `pigeonhole_protocols`, with `Cargo.toml` at the top and its source in `src/`. `testdata/` holds vectors shared with cryptlib, katzenqt and
group_chat_client; `SOURCES` names the commits they were copied from.
`protocols/katzenqt1/client/testdata/scenarios` holds this repository's own client scenarios,
which the Go and Rust clients both run.

## Testing

```
make test rust-test        # unit tests, scenarios, crashes at every action, kill -9
make verify-testdata       # the vectors are as copied
make conformance           # against katzenqt and Lean's model: fresh traces both ways
make rust-conformance
make e2e DAEMON=@katzenpost       # two clients over a running client daemon
make interop DAEMON=@katzenpost   # with katzenqt-headless
```

The cross-checks need checkouts of katzenqt (`KATZENQT`) and cryptlib (`CRYPTLIB`). Setting
`RUST_BIN` to `target/release/katzenqt1-rs` runs the process tests with Go and Rust clients
together.
