// Package engine is a katzenqt1 group chat client without IO: Step takes the state and one
// input, from the user or from the network, and returns the network work it asks for and what
// changed. The caller saves what changed before it carries out any of the work.
//
// The member state machine is driven as katzenqt's adapter drives it: Compose for each message
// sent, Written once its box is written, Observe for each box read in order, Handle for a new
// epoch and for a user's scan, and for a new member BeginInduction, then once everything owed is
// written Reply, then IntroduceNow.
