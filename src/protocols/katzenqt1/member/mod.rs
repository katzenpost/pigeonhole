//! One member of one katzenqt1 group chat: a state machine over [`Group`], driven either by
//! events ([`Group::handle`], returning effects) or by a client that reads and writes itself
//! ([`Group::observe`], [`Group::compose`], [`Group::written`]). A member never derives a BACAP
//! index, encrypts, or touches the network itself.
